### Salut | Hello ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Paul Wambo. I am a Data Scientist (Computational Biologist) with a background in both Biochemistry and Computer Science. I love applying my knowledge to solve challenging problems in the life sciences, especially at the intersection between chemistry, structural biology, genomics and machine learning.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Bio-Diffusion-Playground](https://github.com/poloarol/bio-diffusion-playground), [Peptide Descriptors](https://github.com/poloarol/peptide-descriptors)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning R programming, Julia Programming
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Continously improving my general skills and knowledge of Deep learning methods and Computational biology
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on [Bio-Diffusion-Playground](https://github.com/poloarol/bio-diffusion-playground), [Peptide Descriptors](https://github.com/poloarol/peptide-descriptors)
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with [Peptide Descriptors](https://github.com/poloarol/peptide-descriptors): To apply Density Functional Theory (DFT) to predict properties of peptides containing non-canonical of amino acids
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
