### Salut | Hello ðŸ‘‹, 

I'm Paul Wambo. I am a Data Scientist (Computational Biologist) with a background in both Biochemistry and Computer Science. I love applying my knowledge to solve challenging problems in the life sciences, especially at the intersection between chemistry, structural biology, genomics and machine learning.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Currently learning best practices for pipeline development using both Snakemake and Nextflow
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m Continously improving my general skills and knowledge of Deep learning methods and Computational biology
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about bioinformatics, application of machine learning methods in drug discovery or anything you think my skills are aligned with
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him
